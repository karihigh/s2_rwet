       "'The division of labor among nations is that some specialize in winning and others in losing  Our part of the world  known today as Latin America  was precocious: it has specialized in losing ever since those remote times when Renaissance Europeans ventured across the ocean and buried their teeth in the throats of the Indian civilizations  Centuries passed  and Latin America perfected its role  We are no longer in the era of marvels when fact surpassed fable and imagination was shamed by the trophies of conquest the lodes of gold  the mountains of silver  But our region still works as a menial  It continues to exist at the service of others\\' needs  as a source and reserve of oil and iron  of copper and meat  of fruit and coffee  the raw materials and foods destined for rich countries which profit more from consuming them than Latin America does from producing them  The taxes collected by the buyers are much higher than the prices received by the sellers; and after all  as Alliance for Progress coordinator Covey T  Oliver said in July 1968  to speak of fair prices is a \"medieval\" concept  for we are in the era of free trade  The more freedom is extended to business  the more prisons have to be built for those who suffer from that business  Our inquisitor hangman systems function not only for the dominating external markets; they also provide gushers of profit from foreign loans and investments in the dominated internal markets  Back in 1913  President Woodrow Wilson observed: \"You hear of \\'concessions\\' to foreign capitalists in Latin America  You do not hear of concessions to foreign capitalists in the United States  They are not granted concessions \" He was confident: \"States that are obliged to grant concessions are in this condition  that foreign interests are apt to dominate their domestic affairs\" he said  and he was right  Along the way we have even lost the right to call ourselves Americans  although the Haitians and the Cubans appeared in history as new people a century before the Mayflower pilgrims setded on the Plymouth coast  For the world today  America is just the United States; the region we inhabit is a sub America  a second class America of nebulous identity  Latin America is the region of open veins  Everything  from the discovery until our times  has always been transmuted into European  or later United States capital  and as such has accumulated in distant centers of power  Everything: the soil  its fruits and its mineral rich depths  the people and their capacity to work and to consume  natural resources and human resources  Production methods and class structure have been successively determined from outside for each area by meshing it into the universal gearbox of capitalism  To each area has been assigned a function  always for the benefit of the foreign metropolis of the moment  and the endless chain of dependency has been endlessly extended  The chain has many more than two links  In Latin America it also includes the oppression of small countries by their larger neighbors and  within each country\\'s frontiers  the exploitation by big cities and ports of their internal sources of food and labor  (Four centuries ago sixteen of today\\'s twenty biggest Latin American cities already existed ) For those who see history as a competition  Latin America\\'s backwardness and poverty are merely the result of its failure  We lost; others won  But the winners happen to have won thanks to our losing: the history of Latin America\\'s underdevelopment is  as someone has said  an integral part of the history of world capitalism\\'s development  Our defeat was always implicit in the victory of others; our wealth has always generated our poverty by nourishing the prosperity of others the empires and their native overseers  In the colonial and neocolonial alchemy  gold changes into scrap metal and food into poison  Potosf  Zacatecas  and Ouro Preto became desolate warrens of deep  empty tunnels from which the precious metals had been taken; ruin was the fate of Chile\\'s nitrate pampas and of Amazonia\\'s rubber forests  Northeast Brazil\\'s sugar and Argentina\\'s quebracho belts  and communities around oil rich Lake Maracaibo  have become painfully aware of the mortality of wealth which nature bestows and imperialism appropriates  The rain that irrigates the centers of imperialist power drowns the vast suburbs of the system  In the same way  and symmetrically  the well being of our dominating classes dominating inwardly  dominated from outside  is the curse of our multitudes condemned to exist as beasts of burden  The gap widens  Around the middle of the last century the world\\'s rich countries enjoyed a 50 percent higher living standard than the poor countries  Development develops inequality: in April 1969 Richard Nixon told the Organization of American States (OAS) that by the end of the twentieth century the United States\\' per capita income would be fifteen times higher than Latin America\\'s  The strength of the imperialist system as a whole rests on the necessary inequality of its parts  and this inequality assumes ever more dramatic dimensions  The oppressor countries get steadily richer in absolute terms and much more so in relative terms through the dynamic of growing disparity  The capitalist \"head office\" can allow itself the luxury of creating and believing its own myths of opulence  but the poor countries on the capitalist periphery know that myths cannot be eaten  The United States citizen\\'s average income is seven times that of a Latin American and grows ten times faster  And averages are deceptive in view of the abyss that yawns between the many poor and the rich few south of the Rio Grande  According to the United Nations  the amount shared by 6 million Latin Americans at the top of the social pyramid is the same as the amount shared by 140 million at the bottom  There are 60 million campesinos whose fortune amounts to $ 25 a day  At the other extreme  the pimps of misery accumulate $5 billion in their private Swiss or U S  bank accounts  Adding insult to injury  they squander in sterile ostentation and luxury  and in unproductive investments constituting no less than half the total investment  the capital that Latin America could devote to the replacement  extension  and generation of job creating means of production  Harnessed as they have always been to the constellation of imperialist power  our ruling classes have no interest whatsoever in determining whether patriotism might not prove more profitable than treason  and whether begging is really the only formula for international politics  Sovereignty is mortgaged because \"there\\'s no other way \" The oligarchies\\' cynical alibis confuse the impotence of a social class with the presumed empty destinies of their countries  Says Josue de Castro: \"I  who have received an international peace prize  think that  unhappily  there is no other solution than violence for Latin America \" In the eye of this hurricane 120 million children are stirring  Latin America\\'s population grows as does no other: it has more than tripled in half a century  One child dies of disease or hunger every minute  but in the year 2000 there will be 650 million Latin Americans  half of whom will be under fifteen: a time bomb  Among the 280 million Latin Americans of today  50 million are unemployed or underemployed and about 100 million are illiterate; half of them live in crowded  unhealthy slums  Latin America\\'s three largest markets Argentina  Brazil  and Mexico together consume less than France or West Germany  although their combined population considerably exceeds that of any European country  In proportion to population  Latin America today produces less food than it did before World War II  and at constant prices there has been a threefold decline in its per capita exports since the eve of the 1929 crisis  For its foreign masters and for our commission agent bourgeoisie  who have sold their souls to the devil at a price that would have shamed Faust  the system is perfecdy rational; but for no one else  since the more it develops  the greater its disequilibrium  its tensions  and its contradictions  Even industrialization coming late and in dependent form  and comfortably coexisting with the latifundia and the structures of inequality helps to spread unemployment rather than to relieve it; poverty is extended  wealth concentrated in the area where an ever multiplying army of idle hands is available  New factories are built in the privileged poles of development Sao Paulo  Buenos Aires  Mexico City but less and less labor is needed  The system did not foresee this small headache  this surplus of people  And the people keep reproducing  They make love with enthusiasm and without precaution  Ever more people are left beside the road  without work in the countryside  where the latifundios reign with their vast extensions of idle land  without work in the city where the machine is king  The system vomits people  North American missionaries sow pills  diaphragms  intrauterine devices  condoms  and marked calendars  but reap children  Latin American children obstinately continue getting born  claiming their natural right to a place in the sun in these magnificent lands which could give to all what is now denied to almost all  At the beginning of November 1968 Richard Nixon loudly confirmed that the Alliance for Progress was seven years old and that malnutrition and food shortages had nevertheless intensified in Latin America  A few months earlier  in April  George W  Ball wrote in Life: \"But at least for the next several decades  the discontent of poorer nations does not threaten world destruction  Shameful as it undoubtedly may be  the world has lived at least two thirds poor and one third rich for generations  Unjust as it may be  the power of poor countries is limited \"2 Ball had headed the U S  delegation to the First Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva  and had voted against nine of the twelve general principles approved by the conference for removing some of the handicaps of the underdeveloped countries in international trade  The human murder by poverty in Latin America is secret; every year  without making a sound  three Hiroshima bombs explode over comlunities that have become accustomed to suffering with clenched teeth  This systematic violence is not apparent but is real and constantly increasing: its holocausts are not made known in the sensational press but in Food and Agricultural Organization statistics  Ball says that it is still possible to act with impunity because the poor cannot set off a world war  but the Imperium is worried: unable to multiply the dinner  it does what it can to suppress the diners  \"Fight poverty  kill a beggar!\" some genius of black humor scrawled on a wall in La Paz  What do the heirs to Malthus propose but to kill all the beggars to be before they are born? Robert McNamara  the World Bank president who was chairman of Ford and then secretary of defense  has called the population explosion the greatest obstacle to progress in Latin America; the World Bank  he says  will give priority in its loans to countries that implement birth control plans  McNamara notes with regret that the brains of the poor do 25 percent less thinking  and the World Bank technocrats (who have already been born) set computers humming to produce labyrinthine abracadabras on the advantages of not being born: \"If \" one of the Bank\\'s documents assures us  \"a developing country with an average per capita income of $150 to $200 a year succeeds in reducing its fertility by 50 percent in a period of twenty five years  at the end of thirty years its per capita income will be higher by at least 40 percent than the level it would otherwise have achieved  and twice as high after sixty years \" Lyndon B  Johnson\\'s remark has become famous: \"Let us act on the fact that less than $5 invested in population control is worth $100 invested in economic growth \"3 Dwight D  Eisenhower prophesied that if the world\\'s inhabitants continued multiplying at the same rate  not only would the danger of revolution be increased  but there would also be a lowering of living standards for all peoples  including his own  The United States is more concerned than any other country with spreading and imposing family planning in the farthest outposts  Not only the government  but the Rockefeller and the Ford foundations as well  have nightmares about millions of children advancing like locusts over the horizon from the third world  Plato and Aristode considered the question before Malthus and McNamara; in our day this global offensive plays a well defined role  Its aim is to justify the very unequal income distribution between countries and social classes  to convince the poor that poverty is the result of the children they don\\'t avoid having  and to dam the rebellious advance of the masses  While intrauterine devices compete with bombs and machine gun salvos to arrest the growth of the Vietnamese population  in Latin America it is more hygienic and effective to kill guerrilleros in the womb than in the mountains or the streets  Various U S  missions have sterilized thousands of women in Amazonia  although this is the least populated habitable zone on our planet  Most Latin American countries have no real surplus of people; on the contrary  they have too few  Brazil has thirty eight times fewer inhabitants per square mile than Belgium  Paraguay has forty nine times fewer than England  Peru has thirty two times fewer than Japan  Haiti and El Salvador  the human antheaps of Latin America  have lower population densities than Italy  The pretexts invoked are an insult to the intelligence; the real intentions anger us  No less than half the territory of Bolivia  Brazil  Chile  Ecuador  Paraguay  and Venezuela has no inhabitants at all  No Latin American population grows less than Uruguay\\'s a country of old folk yet no nation has taken such a beating in recent years  with a crisis that would seem to drag it into the last circle of hell  Uruguay is empty  and its fertile lands could provide food for infinitely more people than those who now suffer in such penury  Over a century ago a Guatemalan foreign minister said prophetically: \"It would be strange if the remedy should come from the United States  the same place which brings us the disease \" Now that the Alliance for Progress is dead and buried the Imperium proposes  more in panic than in generosity  to solve Latin America\\'s problems by eliminating Latin Americans; Washington has reason to suspect that the poor peoples don\\'t prefer to be poor  But it is impossible to desire the end without desiring the means  Those who deny liberation to Latin America also deny our only possible rebirth  and incidentally absolve the existing structures from blame  Our youth multiplies  rises  listens: what does the voice of the system offer? The system speaks a surrealist language  In lands that are empty it proposes to avoid births; in countries where capital is plentiful but wasted it suggests that capital is lacking; it describes as \"aid\" the deforming orthopedics of loans and the draining of wealth that results from foreign investment; it calls upon big landowners to carry out agrarian reforms and upon the oligarchy to practice social justice  The class struggle only exists  we are told  because foreign agents stir it up; but social classes do exist and the oppression of one by the other is known as the Western way of life  The Marines undertake their criminal expeditions only to restore order and social peace; the dictatorships linked to Washington lay foundations in their jails for the law abiding state  and ban strikes and smash trade unions to protect the freedom to work  Is everything forbidden us except to fold our arms? Poverty is not written in the stars; underdevelopment is not one of God\\'s mysterious designs  Redemptive years of revolution pass; the ruling classes wait and meanwhile pronounce hellfire anathema on everybody  In a sense the right wing is correct in identifying itself with tranquillity and order: it is an order of daily humiliation for the majority  but an order nonetheless; it is a tranquillity in which injustice continues to be unjust and hunger to be hungry  If the future turns out to be a Pandora\\'s box  the conservative has reason to shout  \"I have been betrayed \" And the ideologists of impotence  the slaves who look at themselves with the master\\'s eyes  are not slow to join in the outcry  The bronze eagle of the Maine  thrown down on the day the Cuban Revolution triumphed  now lies abandoned  its wings broken  in a doorway in the old town in Havana  Since that day in Cuba  other countries have set offon different roads on the experiment of change: perpetuation of the existing order of things is perpetuation of the crime  Recovery of the resources that have always been usurped is recovery of our destiny  The ghosts of all the revolutions that have been strangled or betrayed through Latin America\\'s tortured history emerge in the new experiments  as if the present had been foreseen and begotten by the contradictions of the past  History is a prophet who looks back: because of what was  and against what was  it announces what will be  And so this book  which seeks to chronicle our despoliation and at the same time explain how the current mechanisms of plunder operate  will present in close proximity the caravelled conquistadors and the jet propelled technocrats; Hernan Corte\\'s and the Marines; the agents of the Spanish Crown and the International Monetary Fund missions; the dividends from the slave trade and the profits of General Motors  And  too  the defeated heroes and revolutions of our time  the infamies and the dead and resurrected hopes: the fertile sacrifices  When Alexander von Humboldt investigated the customs of the ancient inhabitants of the Bogotd plateau  he found that the Indians called the victims of ritual ceremonies quihica  Quihica meant \"door\"; the death of each chosen victim opened the door to a new cycle of 185 moons '"
