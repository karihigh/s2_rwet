Now, I am going to demonstrate how to fold clothes. The key point here is to feel the piece of clothing with your hands. And communicate your affections through your palms. It is very important to have this sort in mind while you fold your clothes. Holding clothes is not about making it compact but it is about love to communicate your affection and gratitude for their continuous support. First, fold both sleeves like this. Now make a long rectangle with the body of the item in the middle. Then fold it in half. And then fold it into a third. When a piece of clothing is folded correctly it will stand. Lets fold other pieces of clothing in the same way. For a camisole once again, get a feel for the piece. Stroke it with your hands. The basics of folding here is to fold the widths ways to a third. The key point with camisole is to include the strobes of part of its length and fold almost in half. And then fold. Fold again into a third. Voila it stands. Now lets fold socks. What I do not recommend is to make them into a ball like this. Why not? Because the elastic in the opening of the sock gets ruined. Correctly put both socks together by laying one on the other and fold in half. And once again in half. When they are folded correctly they will also stand. As you see, fold all the clothes in such ways so that they stand on their own they will look neat and tidy.
