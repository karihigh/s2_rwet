## Transcription of a video

I remember a couple of years ago that my godmother (Laila) started renewing her apartment because of huge allergy she had to her cat. She had to remove the carpeted floor and install wood, clean every curtain and of course, that meant to tidy every room. 
For some reason, Marie Kondo's book came into her hands and she was thrilled by the minimalist ways of keeping her stuff in order. 
She told me about it and I laughed at the way her closet was looking, but also felt curious about the little rolls of clothes on her shelf.
In the past months, suddenly Marie Kondo became a trending topic. Laila, who though very original of herself, couldn't understand why now everybody was talking about her personal discovery. 
A Netflix series had being launched and now everybody was thrilled by Kondo's methods. 
Even though this method sound like an excellent opportunity to decrease the amount of things we own, and in consequence, somehow reduce consumism in the world. 
But I found myself with 2 or more people at The Container Store, shoppig specifically for drawers separators to achieve the perfect tidyness that Marie owns.
So maybe in the short term, this series will have some bad effects. 

Inspired by one of Julio Cort√°zar ironic short story "Instructions to climb a staircase", I wanted to see how instructions to fold clothes would sound like written. 
Here is the transcription: 

Now, I am going to demonstrate how to fold clothes. The key point here is to feel the piece of clothing with your hands. And communicate your affections through your palms. It is very important to have this sort in mind while you fold your clothes. Holding clothes is not about making it compact but it is about love to communicate your affection and gratitude for their continuous support. First, fold both sleeves like this. Now make a long rectangle with the body of the item in the middle. Then fold it in half. And then fold it into a third. When a piece of clothing is folded correctly it will stand. Lets fold other pieces of clothing in the same way. For a camisole once again, get a feel for the piece. Stroke it with your hands. The basics of folding here is to fold the widths ways to a third. The key point with camisole is to include the strobes of part of its length and fold almost in half. And then fold. Fold again into a third. Voila it stands. Now lets fold socks. What I do not recommend is to make them into a ball like this. Why not? Because the elastic in the opening of the sock gets ruined. Correctly put both socks together by laying one on the other and fold in half. And once again in half. When they are folded correctly they will also stand. As you see, fold all the clothes in such ways so that they stand on their own they will look neat and tidy.
