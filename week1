## Transcription of a video

I remember a couple of years ago that my godmother (Laila) started renewing her apartment because of huge allergy she had to her cat. She had to remove the carpeted floor and install wood, clean every curtain and of course, that meant to tidy every room. 
For some reason, Marie Kondo's book came into her hands and she was thrilled by the minimalist ways of keeping her stuff in order. 
She told me about it and I laughed at the way her closet was looking, but also felt curious about the little rolls of clothes on her shelf.
In the past months, suddenly Marie Kondo became a trending topic. Laila, who though very original of herself, couldn't understand why now everybody was talking about her personal discovery. 
A Netflix series had being launched and now everybody was thrilled by Kondo's methods.
